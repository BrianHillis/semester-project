Semester Project for Software Engineering

## First Sprint (Sprint 0) Information
Your goals are twofold: 
1. Configure your technology environment
2. Assemble use cases and a requirements document
3. [Detailed Instructions are here.](./semester-project.md)

## Augur Specific Requirements and Design Materials
1. [Data model for the git database, Facade](./augur/git_minimal.pdf)

## RJI Specific Requirements and Design Materials

## Zephyr Specific Requirements and Design Materials

## Sprint 1: The Design Sprint (Due: April 14, 11:59pm)
1. Complete the setup of deployment environment
2. Design
    1. Clarify functional requirements for the use cases defined in Sprint 0 and document them. 
    2. Create an ERD
    3. Create a design document showing what is necessary for your use cases to lead to a solution
        + Data sources
        + Functions 
        + Source code
        + How different software components communicate 
        + Rationale for choices you make
3. Database
    1. Create the DDL for building your database. Save the schema in your GitHub repository 
    2. Implement the database in a schema, including "dummy data"
4. At stubs for your code/methods/use cases
5. Test the URL for your deployed environment
6. Describe the languages you need to use and how you will learn enough to implement the project (hint: examples)
